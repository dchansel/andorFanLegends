Then the stall became a hovel, La taverne du Troll Ivre. All Andor came and went here, and landlady Gilda, Erloth's granddaughter, was known and loved throughout the land.

The drunken troll is ravaging the tavern!\"","year":"2014","players":"2-6","difficulty":[2],"officialBonus":false,"board":[1],"boxExt":[8,9,1],"additionaldownload":null,"download":"http://legendsofandor.com/fan-legend-tavern-turmoil","type":"single","series":null,"number":null,"newCardOpenIndex":null,"showPdf":false,"cards":[]}
